/// @page overview High level overview of wrapped interval analysis
/// This document contains a high level overview of the wrapped interval analysis.
///
/// Brief Description of Code
///
/// We provide two LLVM passes:
///
/// -range-analysis and
///
/// -wrapped-range-analysis. 
///
/// The former corresponds to the classical fixed-width interval analysis
/// and the latter to our wrapped interval analysis.
///
/// The implementation contains the main following classes:
///
/// FixpointSSI. This class implements an intraprocedural generic forward
/// abstract interpreter. It is generic in the sense that it calls only
/// methods from the virtual class AbstractValue. To plug in a new
/// abstract domain should not be too hard. It should suffice to implement
/// the methods from AbstractValue class. (It is worth mentioning that the
/// fixpoint although sound it is imprecise for relational abstract
/// domains due to the separate treatment of phi nodes.) The fixpoint is a
/// classical iterative worklist-based fixpoint. It executes all
/// instructions in the worklist until it is empty. Whenever an
/// instruction changes the value of some variable its users (here we take
/// advantage of the def-use chains available in LLVM) are added into the
/// worklist. We only reason about variables that are in SSA form. The
/// only non-standard feature is in the use of SSI (Static Single
/// Information) form.  SSI form is an extension of SSA form that ensures
/// that a variable can be used only once through any path in the CFG. To
/// do that, SSI adds "sigma nodes" in addition to phi nodes. E.g., given
/// the following code:
///
///if (x>=5)
///
///   y = x;
///
/// else
///
///   z = x;
///
///endif
///
///Its SSI version is:
///
///if (x>=5)
///
///   x.1 = sigma(x, if coming from then branch)
///
///else
///
///   x.2 = sigma(x, if coming from else branch)
///
///endif
///
///x.3 = phi(x.1,x.2) 
///
///Note that SSI form redefines x in the then branch to x.1 and x.2 in
///the else. Since x.1 and x.2 are in SSA form then, it is
///straightforward for the analysis to refine x.1 to [5,+oo] and x.2 to
///[-oo,4], respectively.
///
///SSI form is used for backward analyses but, in fact, it is not needed
///for forward analyses like ours. The main advantage of SSI is that it
///allows us to keep a unique map from variables to abstract
///values. Without SSI, each basic block should keep its own mapping
///which causes an important overhead when merging the mappings
///across blocks. 
///
///- AbstractValue: virtual class that declares main operations called by
///  the fixpoint (e.g., standard classical abstract operations such as
///  join, meet, etc).
///
///- BaseRange: derived class from AbstractValue that implements common
///  methods to Range and WrappedRange.
///
///- Range: derived class from BaseRange that implements interval
///  analysis.
///
///- WrappedRange: derived class from BaseRange that implements our
///  wrapped interval analysis.
